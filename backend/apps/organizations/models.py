"""Tenancy core: an `Organization` is any place the platform is used, and a
`OrganizationMembership` is one person's role *inside* one of them.

`users.User` stays a global identity on purpose — the same person can teach at a
school and run a club, so which role they hold must never live on the user row.
It lives here, per organization, which is what makes "a school director is not
automatically a club admin" fall out of the data model instead of being a rule
somewhere in a view.
