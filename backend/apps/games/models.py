class PooledQuestion(TimeStampedModel):
    """The universal question bank: one row per question, belonging to a
    **subject**, and served to *any* game (see `question_service.get_questions`).

    A question is content, not gameplay — Arqon tortish, Jang maydoni, Duel and
    any future game all draw from this same table and only differ in how they
    present it, so a teacher never has to enter a question once per game.

    `school_class` narrows a question to one class's level; leaving it empty
    ("butun fanga tegishli") makes it part of the subject-wide bank every
    student of that subject can draw from. It is a *preference*, never a
    requirement — the draw always falls back to the rest of the subject so a
    student is never locked out of a game by a class that simply has no pool
    of its own.

    Pools are pre-generated in batches by AI (`services.refill_pool`) or seeded
    by hand (`manage.py seed_game_questions`) so a game's live start never has
    to wait on — or burn through the rate limit of — a real-time Gemini call.
