"""The one place questions are drawn from.

Every consumer of questions — the self-serve games in `apps.games.services`,
the AI/classmate duels in `apps.duels.services`, and anything added later —
goes through `get_questions`. A game never owns or filters questions itself; it
only says *how many* it needs and *how* it will present them.

    SUBJECT -> question bank -> this service -> any game -> session -> XP

The subject is the only hard filter. A question written for Literature is only
ever served to a Literature session, whatever else sits in the bank; the class
a question was authored for is a *preference* that picks the most suitable
question first, never a gate — a student whose own class has no pool of its own
still plays, drawing from the rest of their subject's bank.
